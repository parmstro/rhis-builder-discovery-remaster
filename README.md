# rhis-builder-discovery-remaster
An ansible role for generating a customized foreman discovery image for kexec usage.
This still builds forman discovery image and will work for customizing PXE based boots.
Unfortunately, kexec has been marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future version of RHEL.
